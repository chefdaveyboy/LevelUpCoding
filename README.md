Level Up Coding is a a Full Stack Javascript Developer rating application. 
Register for an account to begin submitting ratings for folks you know, and watch your own stats grow. Utilize our easy star rating system and enjoy our clean UI!


(Original design  plan was to be a general developer rating application, with an Employer component, allowing employees to sign up for accounts, and developers only being able to see those they work with. We have moved this piece of our plan to future development.)
